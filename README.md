# Vue 2 CRM

> A reusable Vue.js CRM starter project for real-world business based on Vue 2 PWA template with Vuetify.

The goal of this project is to create a reusable starter project for real-world business. To achieve this target, we need a solution which includes simple authentication process, restful API with token support and simple but elegant UI design.


#### Features

* This project is built from Vue 2 PWA template by default.
* The UI part is built on the top of Vuetify.
* It inlcudes Vuex and Axios to manage authentication. (Dummy token)
* The token and user profile is managed by Vue-Persisteddstate.
* The dashboard uses vue-chartjs to create charts on dashboard.
* The starter project has integrated progress bar.
* ~~To simulate real-world business, this starter project chooses Json-Server as fake Restful API. (You can simple replace it with your own API).~~
* Fake API is just readonly fake service.
* CRUD functions for Customer, Order and Product


### Live Demo

[Demo App](https://vue-app-demo.harryho.org):  The demo is just a proof of concept. It doesn't have back-end API and all features of master branch.

#### Screenshots ( The actual UI will be slightly different because I am lazy to keep up to date :p )
